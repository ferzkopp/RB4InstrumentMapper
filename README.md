## Requirements

### Software

- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- [WinPCap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/bin/WinPcap_4_1_3.exe) (for wireless peripherals)
- [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) or [vJoy](https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases/latest)

### Hardware

- Xbox One wireless receiver (for wireless peripherals)
  - This is *not* the same as Xbox 360 wireless receivers! You must get an Xbox One (or just "Xbox") receiver, such as [this one](https://amzn.to/2W7qQbt). Third-party receivers are untested, and they will not be deliberately supported.

## Installation

### Wireless Devices (Pcap)

Rock Band 4 guitars and drumkits, connected through an Xbox One receiver. This section of setup is not required if you will only be using USB devices.

Install [WinPCap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/bin/WinPcap_4_1_3.exe). This will be used to capture packets from the Xbox One receiver.

### Wired Devices (USB)

Rock Band 4 wireless legacy adapter, Guitar Hero Live guitar/dongle. This section of setup is not required if you will only be using wireless devices through an Xbox One receiver.

You will need to install the WinUSB driver onto each device you wish to use. **RB4InstrumentMapper is capable of doing this directly, through the `Configure Devices` button on its main menu.** However, if you run into any issues, this method of installing the driver will work as an alternative.

1. Download [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and run it.
2. Under Options, select `List All Devices`.
3. Select your device, then change the box to the right of the green/orange arrow to the `WinUSB` driver. Things should look like the example below:

   ![Zadig Example](/Docs/Images/Zadig.png "Zadig Example")

4. Hit `Replace Driver`, and repeat for any additional peripherals you wish to use.

To undo this process, press Windows + X and select `Device Manager`, then find the device under the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category (*not `Universal Serial Bus controllers`*), right-click it and hit Uninstall, and check the checkbox that says `Uninstall driver software for this device.`.

***DO NOT INSTALL THE DRIVER ON YOUR XBOX ONE RECEIVER!!!*** RB4InstrumentMapper is not capable of handling it in this state, and it will become nonfunctional until you uninstall the device in Device Manager.

### Controller Emulation Driver

This is the part that allows RB4InstrumentMapper to send inputs based on the packets it receives. It is required for both wired and wireless devices.

- Both of these can be installed simultaneously if desired, however RB4InstrumentMapper will only use one of them at a time.
- Option 1: [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest)
  - Recommended, as it requires no configuration and is significantly easier to use. All device outputs will match those of their Xbox 360 counterparts.
- Option 2: [vJoy](https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases/latest)
  - Supported as an alternative to ViGEmBus, in case of issues. Requires some setup:
  1. Download and install vJoy.
  2. After installing, open your Start menu, find the `vJoy` folder, and open the `Configure vJoy` program inside it.
  3. Configure one device for each one of your controllers, using these settings:
     - Number of Buttons: 16
     - POV Hat Switch: Continuous, POVs: 1
     - Axes: `X`, `Y`, `Z`

  4. Click Apply.

### Jaguar Guitar Firmware Update

Jaguar guitars require a firmware update in order to connect to Xbox One receivers.

## Usage

### Wireless Devices (Pcap)

- Ensure the `Enable` checkbox under the Pcap group is checked.
- Select your Xbox One receiver from the dropdown menu.
  - Xbox receivers should be detected automatically. If they are not, click the `Auto-Detect Pcap` button and follow its instructions.
- **Do not connect your instruments yet!** Hit the Start button first, or else devices may not function correctly.
  - A best effort is made for devices connected before starting, but correct behavior cannot be ensured for them.
- After hitting Start, connect your instruments. They will be picked up and mapped automatically as long as the program is running.

Some guitars/drumkits might not sync properly when using just the sync button. This includes the PDP drumkit and occasionally the Jaguar guitar. Follow these steps to sync your device correctly:

1. Go to Windows settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices
2. Click `Add Bluetooth or other device` and pick the `Everything else` option.
3. Press and hold the sync button until the Xbox button light flashes quickly.
4. Select `Xbox compatible game controller` from the list once it appears.
5. If that doesn't work, restart your PC and try again.

### Wired Devices (USB)

- Ensure the `Enable` checkbox under the USB group is checked.
- **Ensure you have installed WinUSB on the devices you want to use! They will not be recognized otherwise!**
  - You can do this easily by hitting the `Configure Devices` button under the USB group.
- Devices will be detected automatically as they are connected/removed, though they will not be mapped until you hit Start.

### Starting the program

Select either ViGEmBus or vJoy in the Controller Type dropdown, then hit the Start button. Devices will be picked up and mapped automatically until you hit Stop or close the program.

### Mapping your controls in Clone Hero

Now that the program is running, map your controls for each instrument in Clone Hero:

1. Press Space on the main menu.
2. Click Assign Controller and press a button on the device for it to be assigned.
3. Click the slots in the Controller column to map each of the controls.
4. Repeat for each connected device.
5. Click `Done`.

## Packet Logs

RB4InstrumentMapper is capable of logging packets to a file for debugging purposes. To do so, enable both the `Show Packets (for debugging)` and `Log packets to file` checkboxes, then hit Start. Packet logs get saved to a `RB4InstrumentMapper` > `PacketLogs` folder inside your Documents folder. Make sure to include it when getting help or creating an issue report for packet parsing issues.

Note that these settings are meant for debugging purposes only, leaving them enabled can reduce the performance of the program somewhat.

## Error Logs

In the case that the program crashes, an error log is saved to a `RB4InstrumentMapper` > `Logs` folder inside your Documents folder. Make sure to include it when getting help or creating an issue report for the crash.
